This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project focused on exploring the [`Legend State Manager`](https://github.com/LegendApp/legend-state).

Legend-State is an opensource, super fast and powerful state library for JavaScript apps with four primary goals:

1. As easy as possible to use
2. Fastest React state library
3. Fine grained reactivity for minimal renders

This project explores its:

a. Local and fine grained reactivity
b. Context, and Computed
c. Global and More reactivity

## Getting Started

First clone the project, and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
